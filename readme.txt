Files
=========
SentimentCNN: Main class used for sentiment analysis.
scnn_utils: Utilities used by the class for cleaning data.
scnn_tests: Various tests and demos for each data set.

By default, simply run scnn_tests.py to run the Sentiment CNN
on the Rotten Tomatoes movie review data set. It will output
its training accuracy at every step, and will write results
to a summary file. These summary files can be used with
TensorBoard to view how the model learns over time.

Data
========
Paths to data are currently hard coded into each of the demo
methods. Feel free to update them to whatever you wish.
